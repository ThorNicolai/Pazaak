## Pazaak school project @ HoGent 

### I had an assignment to do analysis, design and code Pazaak, a popular card game.

This project was in a group of 4 and was completed succesfully although there were a lot of misperceptions within the team. I think the 3 of us that did most of all the coding and work have learned a lot in this project. How to work with git for starters and how to manage a team.
